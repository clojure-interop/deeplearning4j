(ns org.deeplearning4j.spark.impl.multilayer.scoring.ScoreExamplesFunction
  "Function to score examples individually. Note that scoring is batched for computational efficiency.
 This is essentially a Spark implementation of the MultiLayerNetwork.scoreExamples(DataSet, boolean) method
 Note: This method returns a score for each example, but the association between examples and scores is lost. In
 cases where we need to know the score for particular examples, use ScoreExamplesWithKeyFunction"
