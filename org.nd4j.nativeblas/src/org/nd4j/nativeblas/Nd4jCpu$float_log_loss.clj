(ns org.nd4j.nativeblas.Nd4jCpu$float_log_loss
  "Implementation of logarithmic loss function ( y_i * log(p_i)  (1 - y_i) * log(1 - p_i) )
 Input arrays:
 0: predictions - the predicted values, type float
 1: weights - is used for weighting (multiplying) of loss values, type float.
 Can be single scalar or has the same rank as labels, and must be broadcastable to labels.
 2: labels - ground truth vales, type float.
 Must have the same shape as predictions.
 Input integer arguments:
 0: type of reduction to apply to loss
 0 - \"none\", unreduced weighted losses with the same shape as predictions
 1 - \"weighted_sum\", output is scalar and equal to sum of all elements of weightedLosses array
 2 - \"weighted_mean\", output is scalar and equal to sum of all elements of weightedLosses array divided by sum of all elements of weightsBroad array
 3 - \"weighted_sum_by_nonzero_weights\", output is scalar and equal to scalar sum of all elements of weightedLosses array divided by number of non-zero weights
 Input float arguments:
 0: a small increment to add to avoid taking a log of zero.
 Output array:
 0: loss values, type float.
 Can be an array with the same shape as predictions or just single scalar, depending on reduction mode (see input integer argument)"
